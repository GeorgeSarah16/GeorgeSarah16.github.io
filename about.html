    <p>
        My name is Sarah George. I am a Junior at The University of Oklahoma studying Accouting and Management Information Systems. Throughout my time at college, I have maintained above a 3.5 GPA and have
        been on the Dean's List every semester. This summer I am planning on doing an Accounting/Finance internship at Bell Textron. My career plan is to be involved in some Accounting field
        or be a Data Analyst. I have always been a fan of working with numbers, which is why I choose accounting. I also have enjoyed working on the behind the scenes aspect of computers
        which is why I chose MIS as my second major.
